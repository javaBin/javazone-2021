                        Following the latest updates from the government and the local authorities regarding the Omicron
                        variant of COVID-19 itâ€™s no longer possible to carry out the conference as planned in Oslo
                        Spektrum. Unfortunately, with only a few days remaining, we have already committed and completed
                        many of the preparations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This means there will be no physical event in Oslo Spektrum on December 7th to 9th, but we are
                        currently looking into what is feasible as an alternative solution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We will continuously update this page with new information.
                    </p>
